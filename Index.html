        <div class="sub-title"><b>A photographic album or photo album, is a series of photographic prints collected by an individual person or family in the form of a book. Some book-form photo albums have compartments which the photos may be slipped into; other albums have heavy paper with an abrasive surface covered with clear plastic sheets, on which surface photos can be put. Older style albums often were simply books of heavy paper on which photos could be glued to or attached to with adhesive corners or pages.</b>
            <br/>
            <b>This project is an online gallery for showing off your photos. The page will consist of at least half a dozen thumbnails, which are reduced-size versions of your images. The idea is that a site visitor should be able to click one of these thumbnails to display the full-size version of the image. Each thumbnail should also display a short caption that describes the image.On the surface, this project is a simple one. Truthfully, the resulting page will look simple, as well. It will look nice, mind you, but it will project to the visitor an air of simplicity. The fact that the site looks unsophisticated, however, doesn't mean that it's built that way. As you'll soon learn, this page has some rocking technology under the hood, including a flexbox-based layout, viewport-based sizing, and sophisticated positioning techniques
